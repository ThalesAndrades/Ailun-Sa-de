## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Monitor Smoke Test (Right Now)
**What's Happening**:
```
npm run ios ‚Üí expo run:ios ‚Üí xcodebuild compile ‚Üí simulator launch
```

**What to Expect**:
- App should launch in iOS simulator within 3-5 minutes
- Splash screen appears ‚Üí Login screen
- No red error overlays should appear
- Check Xcode console (Cmd+Shift+Y) for any ERROR level messages

**If It Works** ‚úÖ:
- App launches successfully
- Can tap through screens
- Navigation is smooth
- Visual rendering is clean

**Proceed to**: Phase 2

**If It Fails** ‚ùå:
- Check Xcode error console
- See troubleshooting section below
- Run: `npm run clean && npm install && npm run ios -- --reset-cache`

---

### Phase 2: Set Up Distribution Signing (15 mins)

Once smoke tests pass, you must set up iOS Distribution credentials to export .ipa.

#### Option A: Automatic Signing (EASIEST - Recommended)

1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open ios/AilunSade.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Configure Signing**:
   - Select target: "AilunSade"
   - Tab: "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Check: ‚úÖ "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select: Your Apple ID / Team
   - Xcode will auto-create provisioning profiles

3. **Done!** Xcode will handle all certificate/provisioning setup

#### Option B: Manual Signing (if you have certs/profiles ready)

1. **Get Certificates**:
   - Go to [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
   - Create "iOS Distribution" certificate
   - Create "App Store" provisioning profile for app.ailun
   - Download both

2. **Install Certificate**:
   ```bash
   security import ~/Downloads/ios_distribution.cer \
     -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain \
     -P your_password_here
   ```

3. **Update Export Config**:
   Edit `ios/exportOptions.plist` with your certificate name:
   ```plist
   <key>signingCertificate</key>
   <string>Apple Distribution: Your Name (TEAM_ID)</string>
   <key>provisioningProfileSpecifier</key>
   <string>match AppStore app.ailun</string>
   ```

4. **Done!** Ready for export

**Proceed to**: Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Export to .ipa (3 mins)

Once signing is configured:

```bash
# Export archive to .ipa
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath ios/build/AilunSade.xcarchive \
  -exportOptionsPlist ios/exportOptions.plist \
  -exportPath ios/build

# Verify .ipa was created
ls -lh ios/build/AilunSade.ipa
```

**Expected Result**:
```
-rw-r--r--  ios/build/AilunSade.ipa  (~50-60 MB)
```

**Proceed to**: Phase 4

---

### Phase 4: Submit to App Store (10 mins)

#### Using Xcode GUI (Easiest):

1. **Archive Again** (if you want to use Xcode GUI):
   ```bash
   xcodebuild archive \
     -workspace ios/AilunSade.xcworkspace \
     -scheme AilunSade \
     -archivePath ios/build/AilunSade.xcarchive
   ```

2. **Distribute**:
   - In Xcode: `Product ‚Üí Archive`
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Select "App Store Connect"
   - Follow wizard
   - Submit

#### Using Command Line:

```bash
# Upload .ipa to App Store Connect
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f ios/build/AilunSade.ipa \
  -t ios \
  -u your-apple-id@example.com \
  -p your-app-specific-password
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ App uploaded to App Store Connect
- ‚úÖ Version created in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Ready for metadata and submission

**Proceed to**: Phase 5

---

### Phase 5: Complete App Store Metadata & Submit

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)

   - [ ] Each 1080√ó1920 px or higher
   - [ ] Upload or use defaults

4. **Review Information**:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: App Crashes on Startup
```
‚ùå Red error screen immediately after launch
```

**Check**:
1. Xcode console: `Cmd+Shift+Y` ‚Üí Look for ERROR level messages
2. Backend: Is Supabase reachable?
3. Environment: Are `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` variables set?

**Fix**:
```bash
npm run clean
npm install
npm run ios -- --reset-cache
```

### Issue: Build Hangs or Takes Too Long (>10 mins)
```
‚ùå Process seems stuck, no new output for 5+ minutes
```

**Check**:
1. CPU/Memory: Is machine using all resources?
2. CocoaPods: Try `cd ios && pod install --repo-update`
3. Xcode: Force quit and retry

**Fix**:
```bash
killall xcodebuild expo node 2>/dev/null
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
npm run ios
```

### Issue: "No profiles for 'app.ailun'" (Export Error)
```
‚ùå exportArchive fails: "No profiles found"
```

**Check**:
1. Do you have Apple Developer account?
2. Is app.ailun registered in Developer Portal?
3. Do you have Distribution certificate?

**Fix**:
- Use Option A (Automatic Signing) in Phase 2
- Or create provisioning profile in Developer Portal and use Option B

### Issue: Simulator Doesn't Open
```
‚ùå Build succeeds but simulator never launches
```

**Check**:
1. Simulator running? `xcrun simctl list | grep Booted`
2. Disk space? `df -h /` (need >5GB)
3. Memory? Activity Monitor (need >4GB available)

**Fix**:
```bash
# Boot simulator manually
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"
# Or create new simulator
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 15" com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-15 com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-18-0
```

### Issue: TypeScript Errors During Build
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Many TS warnings but build succeeds anyway
```

**This is EXPECTED**:
- 35 TypeScript warnings are non-critical
- App runs normally despite warnings
- Warnings should be fixed in follow-up PRs
- **Not a blocker for submission**
