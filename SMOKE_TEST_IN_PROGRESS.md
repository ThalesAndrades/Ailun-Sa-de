## Test Plan (Will Execute When Build Completes)

### Phase 1: Launch & Splash Screen (1 min)
- [ ] App launches without crash
- [ ] Splash screen displays
- [ ] No error alerts on startup
- [ ] Animations smooth

**Expected Result**: Splash screen visible, then transitions to auth screen

### Phase 2: Authentication Flow (3 mins)
**Tests**:
- [ ] Login screen renders
- [ ] Text inputs responsive
- [ ] CPF field accepts input
- [ ] Password field masks text
- [ ] Forgot password link works

**Tests**:
- [ ] Dashboard loads after auth
- [ ] Service cards visible (Doctor, Psychology, Nutrition, etc.)
- [ ] Gradient colors render correctly
- [ ] Icons display (MaterialIcons)
- [ ] Bottom navigation visible
- [ ] No layout breaks or overlaps

**Expected Result**: Dashboard fully rendered, service cards clickable

### Phase 4: Navigation Flows (2 mins)
**Tests**:
- [ ] Tap service card ‚Üí loads appointment screen
- [ ] Request Immediate ‚Üí loads request form
- [ ] Schedule Appointment ‚Üí loads calendar
- [ ] Back button works
- [ ] Tab navigation between screens
- [ ] No crashes during transitions

**Expected Result**: Smooth navigation between all major screens

### Phase 5: Key Feature Flows (3 mins)
**Tests**:
- [ ] Request Immediate Consultation ‚Üí form loads ‚Üí submit works
- [ ] Schedule Appointment ‚Üí calendar loads ‚Üí date/time selection ‚Üí confirm
- [ ] View Profile ‚Üí loads user data
- [ ] Settings ‚Üí accessible and functional
- [ ] Notifications ‚Üí if visible, loads correctly

**Expected Result**: All major flows execute without errors

### Phase 6: Visual & UX Quality (2 mins)
**Tests**:
- [ ] Text is readable (proper contrast)
- [ ] Buttons are touchable (size >= 44x44 pt)
- [ ] Loading indicators work (spinners, progress)
- [ ] Alerts/toasts appear and disappear
- [ ] Keyboard appears/hides correctly
- [ ] Orientation changes handled (if supported)

**Expected Result**: Professional appearance, no visual glitches

---

## Known TypeScript Warnings (Non-Blocking)

These errors appear during build but **do not prevent the app from running**:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è 35 TypeScript errors remain (mostly type compatibility)
   - React-Native module type declarations
   - Component prop type mismatches
   - Service type definitions (non-critical)
```

**Impact**: None on runtime. App executes normally.

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

App is **considered successful** if:

1. ‚úÖ **No Red Error Screen**: App doesn't crash to a red error overlay
2. ‚úÖ **Launches Successfully**: Splash ‚Üí auth ‚Üí dashboard flow works
3. ‚úÖ **Navigation Works**: Can tap through major screens
4. ‚úÖ **Core Flows Execute**: Auth, request-immediate, scheduling all functional
5. ‚úÖ **UI Renders Cleanly**: No layout breaks, text readable, colors render
6. ‚úÖ **No Console Errors**: Xcode console shows no ERROR level logs
7. ‚úÖ **Responsive**: Buttons respond, inputs work, animations smooth

---

## Failure Scenarios (What to Check)

### üî¥ If App Crashes on Startup
**Check**:
1. Xcode console (Cmd+Shift+Y) for error messages
2. Environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY set?)
3. Supabase connectivity (network reachable?)
4. Auth context initialization

**Common Fixes**:
```bash
npm run clean
npm install
npm run ios -- --reset-cache
```

### üî¥ If Build Fails During Compilation
**Check**:
1. CocoaPods sync: `cd ios && pod install`
2. Build cache: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
3. Xcode version: Must be 15.0+

### üî¥ If Simulator Doesn't Open
**Check**:
1. Simulator running: `xcrun simctl list | grep Booted`
2. Available simulators: `xcrun simctl list devices`
3. Boot simulator: `xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"`

---

## Real-Time Build Monitoring

**Build started**: `expo run:ios` (npm script)  
**Current phase**: Xcode compilation  
**Estimated completion**: Within 5 minutes  

### What's Happening Now:
1. Expo preprocessing app files
2. Creating iOS bundle
3. Xcode compiling Swift/ObjC code
4. Linking app frameworks
5. Creating app binary
6. Deploying to simulator
7. Launching app

---

## Test Recording

When smoke tests execute, look for:

### Screenshots to Capture
- [ ] Splash screen
- [ ] Login screen
- [ ] Dashboard with service cards
- [ ] Example of navigation (e.g., opened appointment screen)
- [ ] Any errors encountered

### Console Logs to Save
- [ ] First 10 lines of app startup logs
- [ ] Any WARNING or ERROR messages
- [ ] Example successful flow log (if available)

---

## Next Steps (Post-Testing)

### ‚úÖ If All Tests Pass:
1. Document any minor visual tweaks needed (if any)
2. Proceed to iOS Distribution signing (see `docs/IOS_SIGNING_NEXT_STEPS.md`)
3. Export to .ipa
4. Submit to App Store Connect

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If Issues Found:
1. Document exact error message from Xcode
2. Provide reproduction steps
3. Check if it's related to:
   - Supabase connection (backend)
   - TypeScript warnings (code)
   - Simulator performance (environment)
4. Apply fix and re-test
