## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (In Priority Order)

### ✅ Step 1: Smoke Tests (CURRENT — ~5 mins)
**Status**: iOS build running now  
**What to Do**: Wait for app to launch, then:

2. Test login
3. Verify navigation works
4. Check visual rendering

**Expected Outcome**: 
- ✅ App launches without crash

- ✅ Navigation is smooth
- ✅ No error alerts

### ✅ Step 2: Distribution Signing (~15 mins)

# 4. Select your Team ID
# Done!
```

**Option B**: Manual Signing (if you have certs)
```bash
# See: docs/IOS_SIGNING_NEXT_STEPS.md
# Download certs from Apple Developer
# Import to Keychain
# Update exportOptions.plist
```

### ✅ Step 3: Export to .ipa (~3 mins)
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath ios/build/AilunSade.xcarchive \
  -exportOptionsPlist ios/exportOptions.plist \
  -exportPath ios/build

# Result: ios/build/AilunSade.ipa
```

### ✅ Step 4: Submit to App Store (~10 mins)
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
